# Aller Scan

## üìù Introduction
Have you ever struggled to identify allergens in a skincare product? We now offer a convenient solution: simply take a photo of the product's ingredient list, and our program will promptly display all potential allergens contained within it. 

## ‚ú® Features
1. **Allergen Table for Cosmetic**
We conducted a comprehensive search for academic papers on common allergens in cosmetics and skincare products. In the end, we curated a database of these allergens.

2. **Identification Allergen in Ingredient List**
Skincare prodcut has a ingredient list, but it's too small to read. We generate a scanner which could identify the potential allergen in your cosmetics. All user needs to do is just take a photo of the product ingredient list, then put it to our program.

## üñ•Ô∏è Database
(We'll show our database as a csv file that allow user to download in our website)
(We build the database manually with the information the article provided)
